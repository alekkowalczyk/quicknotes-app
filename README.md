Quicknotes - notes app were the simplicity of creating and organizing notes is the top priority. 
90% of the site is for your notes, keeping anything distracting from the notes to the minimum. 
That way it is possible to see plenty of notes at one glance.
Because creating a note is so simple - two clicks away on first visit, 
a way to organize a big number of notes needed to be created - but still keeping the notes simple. 
That is why we created the #hierarchic.hashtag concept. Just type a #hashtag to your note, 
and you have created a main category of notes which is easily accessible. 
Add to it a dot sign - that will create a #hierarchic.hashtag - putting your note into subcategories just as easy accessible. 
Organizing much information wasnâ€™t so easy never before :)
